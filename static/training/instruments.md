# PIDs for Research Instruments: A Guide for Repository Managers

**Authors:** Jana Böhm, Rorie Edmunds, Frederik Springer (PID4NFDI) |

---

Welcome to this training module on **Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for research instruments**. It is designed specifically for **repository managers** working within or connected to the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI).

As a repository manager, you sit at a critical junction: you are not typically
the person *registering* instrument PIDs, but your repository's infrastructure
directly determines whether the connection between datasets and instruments
can be made at all. This course focuses on exactly that role.

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Explain what instrument PIDs are and which PID systems are available
- Describe what good instrument metadata looks like and why it matters
- Understand how instruments should be linked to datasets, publications, and other entities
- Identify the **three concrete actions** repository managers must take to support instrument PIDs
- Apply lessons from two contrasting real-world implementations (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin and the Sensor Management System)

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 10–15 minutes

## 1. What is a PID for an Instrument?

A **Persistent Identifier (PID) for an instrument** is a globally unique and
enduring reference assigned to an individual scientific device — a specific
sensor, microscope, telescope, beamline, or similar physical instrument.

> 💡 **Key distinction:** An instrument PID identifies an **individual physical device**, not a model type or product category. The specific mass spectrometer in Lab 3, Room 204 gets a PID. The brand and model it belongs to does not.

### Why do instruments need PIDs?

Without instrument PIDs, a dataset has no machine-readable way to say
*"this data was generated by that specific device"*. This matters because:

- **Provenance:** Calibration details, software versions, and technical
  specifications are often instrument-specific and critical for interpreting data
- **Reproducibility:** Other researchers need to know exactly which instrument
  was used to assess whether results can be reproduced
- **FAIRness:** Linking datasets to instruments makes both more Findable,
  Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
- **Attribution:** Instrument builders and operators deserve credit for their
  contribution to research output

### The current landscape

Instrument PIDs are **still emerging** in the research community. At the time
of writing, around 1,200 instruments are registered with DataCite and around
2,400 with B2INST — small numbers compared to millions of datasets. This is
precisely why building the right infrastructure now, including in your
repository, matters.

---

## 2. Which PID Systems Are Available?

Two main systems are currently used to register instrument PIDs, both built
on the **PIDINST Metadata Schema** developed by the Research Data Alliance.

### B2INST (ePIC PIDs)

[B2INST](https://b2inst.gwdg.de/) is a service offered by EUDAT that assigns
**ePIC PIDs** to instruments. It directly implements the PIDINST metadata schema
and supports **community extensions** — additional metadata fields that
communities can define for their specific use cases.

B2INST is **free and open to everyone**, with multiple login options. It can
be used by individual researchers for personal instruments, or by institutions
running automated API-based workflows for large instrument collections.

### DataCite (DOIs)

DataCite enables registration of **DOIs for instruments** using its generic
metadata schema. Since schema version 4.5, `"Instrument"` is a recognized
`resourceTypeGeneral`, with a published mapping to the PIDINST schema.

Access requires DataCite membership — the most accessible route for German
organizations is via the **TIB DataCite Consortium**.

### Federated Search

PID4NFDI provides a [Federated Search tool](https://search.pidinst.org) that
queries instruments registered with **both** DataCite and B2INST through a
single interface. Repository managers can use it to explore which instruments
are already registered and how they are connected to other research outputs.

### PIDINST and B2INST vs. DataCite: What's the difference?

Both systems share the same underlying PIDINST metadata schema. The main
practical differences for repository managers are:

| | B2INST (ePIC) | DataCite (DOI) |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free | Requires membership |
| **Extensibility** | Community extensions | Schema-constrained |
| **Recognition** | Growing | Widely established |
| **Link field in your repo** | ePIC PID format | Standard DOI format |

> 💡 **Key point for repository managers:** Your repository needs to be able
> to accept and correctly pass on **both** PID types — ePIC PIDs and DOIs —
> when researchers enter instrument identifiers.

## 3. What Does Good Instrument Metadata Look Like?

Before linking instruments to your repository's datasets, it helps to understand
what a well-described instrument PID record contains. This also informs what
you might want to display or surface from instrument landing pages.

Instrument metadata falls into three categories.

### 3.1 Instrument Information

The core description of the device itself:

| Property | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | LSST Commissioning Camera | The name by which the instrument is known |
| **Model** | LSSTComCam | Full model/version designation |
| **Manufacturer** | SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory | Use ROR ID if available |
| **Type** | Digital Camera | Use controlled vocabulary where possible |
| **Measured variables** | Optical radiance | What the instrument observes/measures |
| **Dimensions/Weight** | Length: 1.4 m, Weight: 290 kg | Include units |
| **Local identifiers** | OSTI ID: 2561361 | Serial numbers, inventory numbers |

### 3.2 Contextual Information

When, where, and how the instrument is operated:

| Property | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Location** | Cerro Pachon, Chile | Coordinates for field instruments |
| **Technical description** | Free-text capabilities overview | Include software, data formats, calibration |
| **Installation date** | August 2022 | "State" at installation (new/reconditioned) |
| **Decommissioning date** | December 2024 | Record when operation ceases |
| **Usage timestamps** | 24 Oct – 11 Dec 2024 | For time-series instruments |
| **Related instruments** | Simonyi Survey Telescope | Parent/child instrument relationships |
| **Related outputs** | DOI of paper, DOI of dataset | Updated over time |

### 3.3 Organizational Information

Who is responsible for the instrument and its PID:

| Property | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner/operator** | SLAC / NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory | Use ROR IDs |
| **PID publisher** | SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory | Who maintains the metadata |
| **Project** | LSST project | Link with project PID if available |
| **Funding** | NSF Grant AST-1258333 | Include funder IDs and grant numbers |
| **Access conditions** | Authorized laboratory staff only | Who can use/access the instrument |
| **Current status** | Decommissioned Dec 2024 | Operational status |

> 💡 **Repository manager note:** When a dataset in your repository
> references an instrument, the instrument's landing page should ideally
> contain a citation suggestion. Encourage instrument registrants to include
> this — and add a pointer to it in your own dataset submission guidance.

## 4. Mid-Course Check ✅

**Question 1**

Which statement about instrument PIDs is correct?

    [( )] An instrument PID identifies a model type, so all devices of the same model share one PID.
    [(X)] An instrument PID identifies an individual physical device — one PID per specific instrument instance.
    [( )] Instrument PIDs are only assigned after a device is decommissioned.
    [( )] Instrument PIDs can only be DOIs, not ePIC PIDs.

**Question 2**

A researcher deposits a dataset in your repository and mentions the
microscope used to collect the data. What is the ideal outcome from an
instrument PID perspective?

    [( )] The researcher adds a free-text description of the microscope in the dataset notes field.
    [( )] The dataset links to the microscope's manufacturer website.
    [(X)] The researcher enters the microscope's instrument PID into a dedicated metadata field, which your repository correctly passes on to DataCite.
    [( )] No action is needed — instrument information belongs only in the publication, not the dataset.

**Question 3**

Your institution is considering which PID system to use for instruments.
Which statement is accurate?

    [( )] B2INST and DataCite use completely different metadata schemas, requiring separate expertise.
    [(X)] Both systems are based on the PIDINST metadata schema, with DataCite requiring membership and B2INST being free.
    [( )] DataCite does not support instrument PIDs — only datasets and publications.
    [( )] B2INST is only suitable for large institutions with automated workflows.

## 5. Linking Instruments to Other Research Entities

This section is the most directly relevant for your day-to-day work as a
repository manager. Understanding how instruments connect to other entities
helps you design and configure your repository appropriately.

### The general principle

Instrument PIDs gain their greatest value when they are **not just registered,
but actively linked** to related research entities. These links can go in two
directions and can be established in two ways:

**Direction:**
- Instrument → Other entity (entered in the instrument's PID metadata)
- Other entity → Instrument (entered in the dataset/publication metadata)

**Method:**
- **Metadata field links** — machine-actionable, structured, searchable
- **Formal citation** — in reference lists of publications/papers (not
  machine-actionable, but important for scholarly credit)

> ✅ **As a repository manager, your primary concern is the
> entity → instrument direction**: ensuring that datasets deposited in
> your repository can link back to the instrument that generated them.

### Key connections and relation types

**Datasets → Instrument** *(your most important link)*

If a dataset PID is registered with DataCite, it should reference the
instrument using:

```
relatedIdentifier relationType="IsCollectedBy"
```

This is the **recommended link** — and it is the one that your repository
infrastructure needs to support.

---

**Instrument → Dataset** *(optional, does not scale)*

The instrument record *may* list datasets it generated via:

```
relatedIdentifier relationType="Collects"  [DataCite]
relatedIdentifier relationType="References"  [PIDINST/B2INST]
```

However, this does **not scale** for widely-used instruments — a single
beamline may generate thousands of datasets. The HZB use case confirms this:
it is simply not feasible to maintain this list centrally. Focus your
effort on the dataset → instrument direction instead.

---

**Publications → Instrument**

Publications should **formally cite** the instrument PID in their reference
list. If registered with DataCite, they should additionally use:

```
relatedIdentifier relationType="References"
```

---

**Instrument → Instrument Papers**

Instrument papers (dedicated journal articles describing the device) should
be linked bidirectionally:

```
[Instrument] relatedIdentifier relationType="IsDescribedBy"
[Paper] relatedIdentifier relationType="Describes"
+ formal citation in the paper's reference list
```

---

**Instrument → Project / Funding**

```
[PIDINST/B2INST] relationType="WasUsedIn"  → project PID
[DataCite]        relationType="IsPartOf"   → project PID
FundingReference.funderIdentifier / awardNumber / awardURI
```

---

**Instrument ←→ Other Instruments**

For complex instrument relationships, several relation types exist:

| Relationship | PIDINST/B2INST | DataCite |
|---|---|---|
| New version of old | `IsNewVersionOf` / `IsPreviousVersionOf` | Same |
| Part of compound instrument | `IsComponentOf` / `HasComponent` | `IsPartOf` / `HasPart` |
| Permanently attached | `IsAttachedTo` | `IsPartOf` |
| Duplicate PIDs | `IsIdenticalTo` | `IsIdenticalTo` |

---

**Samples → Instrument** *(indirect only)*

Direct sample-to-instrument linking is **not recommended** — neither
PIDINST nor DataCite provides a fitting relation type for this. Instead,
samples should link to **datasets and publications**, which in turn link
to instruments. This captures the connection implicitly.

```
Sample → relationType="IsReferencedBy" → Dataset/Publication
Dataset/Publication → relationType="IsCollectedBy" → Instrument
```

---

## 6. The Repository Manager's Three Responsibilities

The linking guidance document distills the repository manager's role into
three concrete tasks. These are your action items.

### Responsibility 1: Provide a metadata field for instrument PIDs

Your repository submission form must offer a dedicated field where
researchers can enter instrument PIDs. This can be:

- A field specifically labeled "Instrument PID" (ideal for instrument-heavy disciplines)
- A general "Related resources" or "Related identifiers" field that accepts
  any PID type (acceptable as a fallback)

The field must accept **both** DOI and ePIC PID formats.

### Responsibility 2: Correctly map the field to DataCite/ePIC

Having a field in your form is not enough. You must ensure that the value
entered by the researcher is **correctly passed through** to DataCite (or
ePIC) in the backend using the right metadata property and relation type:

```
DataCite: relatedIdentifier relationType="IsCollectedBy"
          relatedIdentifierType="DOI" (or "Handle" for ePIC)
```

This is the step that most often fails in practice — the HZB use case
explicitly identifies this as one of the three main barriers to consistent
instrument-dataset linking.

> ⚠️ **Common failure mode:** The repository has a field, but the value
> is stored only locally and never forwarded to DataCite. Verify your
> backend mapping, not just your frontend form.

### Responsibility 3: Inform researchers how to use the field

Researchers are often unaware that the instrument they used has a PID
at all, or that they should enter it when depositing a dataset. Your
repository should:

- Add a short explanation next to the instrument PID field
- Link to the instrument's landing page format / Federated Search
- Encourage researchers to check the instrument's landing page for a
  ready-made citation suggestion (instrument registrants should provide this)

---

## 7. Real-World Example: Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB)

The HZB use case is the most detailed publicly available example of
instrument PID implementation in Germany. Here are the key lessons directly
relevant to repository managers.

### What HZB did

HZB operates the BESSY II synchrotron radiation source and registered
DataCite DOIs for its **beamlines and experiment stations** — custom-built,
one-of-a-kind devices. Registration is handled **centrally** by a single
employee in consultation with the library and instrument scientists.
Registration uses the DataCite REST API; there is no automated integration
with their instrument database (IGAMA).

**Example PID:** [10.5442/NI000001](https://doi.org/10.5442/NI000001) —
the E2 Flat-Cone-Diffractometer at BER II.

### Key lessons for repository managers

**1. Central registration avoids PID duplication**

Because beamlines are shared by many researchers, HZB registers PIDs
centrally rather than letting individual researchers do it. Without this,
one instrument could end up with dozens of conflicting PIDs. This is a
governance decision worth advocating for at your institution.

**2. The dataset → instrument link works when curation is in place**

For datasets published directly via HZB's data service, staff curate the
metadata and ensure the instrument PID is entered. This works reliably
*because* HZB controls the repository. For datasets deposited in external
repositories, this link frequently breaks — because of the three barriers:
researcher unawareness, missing fields, and incorrect backend mapping.

**3. The instrument → dataset direction does not scale**

HZB explicitly decided *not* to maintain a list of all datasets in the
instrument PID metadata. With hundreds of datasets per instrument per year,
this is simply not manageable. The dataset → instrument direction is the
scalable one.

**4. Metadata quality requires effort, but registration is not hard**

HZB reports that the registration process itself is straightforward. The
labour-intensive part is **collecting and reviewing high-quality metadata**.
This is done through a manual draft-and-review cycle between data staff and
instrument scientists.

**5. Instrument papers should cite instrument PIDs**

HZB includes DOIs of instrument papers (published in JLSRF) in the
instrument PID metadata via `relationType="IsDescribedBy"`. The paper in
turn formally cites the instrument. This bidirectional link strengthens
discoverability significantly.

---

## 8. Real-World Example: The Sensor Management System (SMS)

While HZB represents a centralized, facility-scale approach using DataCite DOIs,
the **Sensor Management System (SMS)** represents the opposite end of the
spectrum: a decentralized, community-driven approach using B2INST ePIC PIDs
at large scale. Together, the two cases bracket the full range of implementation
strategies you are likely to encounter.

### What the SMS is

The SMS is an open-source platform for managing sensors, measurement setups,
and campaigns, developed collaboratively by four Helmholtz Centers: GFZ, KIT,
UFZ, and FZJ. It is the entry point for a broader digital ecosystem for FAIR
time-series data in the Earth System Sciences, where sensor data flows from the
SMS through time.IO (storage/visualization) and SaQC (automated quality control).

PID registration is built directly into the SMS workflow: when a user creates a
new device record, they can optionally trigger ePIC PID registration via B2INST
with a single action — essentially ticking a box. Metadata is then **automatically
synchronized** between the SMS and B2INST whenever a record is updated.

**Example PID:** [21.11157/86e53e2e-eb5c-44ab-852d-2d0c2313572c](http://hdl.handle.net/21.11157/86e53e2e-eb5c-44ab-852d-2d0c2313572c) —
the ADCP QLiner 2, an acoustic doppler current profiler managed at GFZ.

### Scale and adoption

As of November 2025, the Helmholtz RF Earth and Environment community in
B2INST has **1,777 registered instruments** — around 80% of all instruments
in B2INST. Roughly half of all SMS devices have a PID, with the decision left
to the individuals responsible for each instrument. Devices range from simple
data loggers and thermometers to lidar systems, weather stations, and
disdrometers.

### Why B2INST rather than DataCite?

The four Helmholtz Centers chose B2INST because it fully implements the PIDINST
metadata schema, including dedicated fields for instrument type, model name,
and measured variables — fields that DataCite's generic schema does not provide
directly. B2INST also aligns with the European EOSC ecosystem, which matters
for infrastructures with international scope.

### Key lessons for repository managers

**1. Low barriers enable scale — but require compensating quality measures**

The SMS deliberately keeps the number of mandatory metadata fields low to
encourage broad adoption. The tradeoff is that metadata completeness varies
across instances. The compensating mechanism is the **controlled vocabulary
server** shared by all Helmholtz Centers, which harmonizes key fields like
manufacturer name and instrument type using community-curated terminology.
This is the structural quality control replacing manual curation.

**2. Automated sync eliminates the maintenance burden**

Once a researcher creates an SMS device record, any subsequent edits are
automatically pushed to B2INST — no separate update workflow needed. This
is a key design principle: reduce the practical cost of keeping PID metadata
current. For repository managers, this is a model worth considering: if your
repository can integrate with a PID registration service at the API level,
automatic metadata forwarding reduces both human error and staff burden.

**3. The self-service model requires good user support infrastructure**

Because anyone at the participating Helmholtz Centers can register instruments
themselves, the SMS invests heavily in user support: a comprehensive Wiki with
tutorial videos, FAQs, and best-practice examples; community meetings; and
GitLab issue tracking for vocabulary curation decisions. Without this
infrastructure, self-service quickly leads to inconsistent metadata.

**4. Controlled vocabulary is essential for interoperability**

The SMS uses controlled vocabulary identifiers for manufacturer names and
instrument types, and references the SeaVoX Device Catalogue for instrument
type terms. This enables machine-readable aggregation and comparison across
institutions — something free-text fields cannot support. Measured variables
are currently the one gap: PIDINST does not yet support a controlled vocabulary
identifier field for them, so they are stored as free text in B2INST.

**5. Related identifiers are the next frontier**

One current limitation of the SMS implementation is that **related identifiers
are not yet used** — meaning instruments are not yet linked to the datasets
they generate or to other instruments (e.g., a sensor linked to its data logger).
This is explicitly identified as a future improvement area. From a repository
manager perspective, this reinforces the point: the dataset → instrument link
via `relationType="IsCollectedBy"` is something *your* repository can and should
support, even when the instrument registrant has not yet built it from their side.

**6. AI-readiness as an emerging motivation**

The SMS explicitly frames its PIDINST-aligned metadata, controlled vocabulary
identifiers, and fully supported JSON APIs as enabling **AI-ready data pipelines**
— where software agents can discover, interpret, and reuse instrument context
without manual intervention. This is a forward-looking argument for investing
in structured instrument metadata now.

### Side-by-side comparison

| | HZB / BESSY II | SMS / NFDI4Earth |
|---|---|---|
| **PID system** | DataCite DOIs | B2INST ePIC PIDs |
| **Registration model** | Centralized (one person) | Decentralized self-service |
| **Scale** | ~24 instruments | ~1,777 instruments |
| **Automation** | Manual API-based | Automated sync with SMS |
| **Metadata quality control** | Manual draft-and-review | Shared controlled vocabulary |
| **Related identifiers** | Instrument papers linked | Not yet implemented |
| **Best suited for** | Large unique infrastructure | Distributed sensor networks |

> 💡 **Take-away for repository managers:** Neither model is universally
> better. The right approach depends on your institution's scale, governance
> structure, and the type of instruments involved. What both models confirm
> is that the **dataset → instrument link** must be supported from the
> repository side — because neither HZB nor the SMS solves this automatically
> for datasets deposited in external repositories.

## 9. Final Assessment ✅

**Question 1**

A researcher deposits a dataset in your repository. They used a DataCite DOI
to identify the instrument. Which DataCite relation type should your repository
use to pass this link to DataCite?

    [( )] relationType="References"
    [( )] relationType="IsDescribedBy"
    [(X)] relationType="IsCollectedBy"
    [( )] relationType="IsPartOf"

**Question 2**

A researcher asks why they should bother entering an instrument PID when
depositing a dataset. Which answer best captures the key reasons?

    [( )] It is a mandatory field and submissions will be rejected without it.
    [(X)] It enables machine-readable provenance, improves FAIRness of the dataset, and allows the instrument's scientific output to be tracked over time.
    [( )] It is only useful for large infrastructure like synchrotrons, not for lab instruments.
    [( )] It creates a formal citation, which counts towards the instrument scientist's publication metrics.

**Question 3**

Your repository currently has a free-text "Notes" field where researchers
sometimes write things like "data collected using the Zeiss LSM 980 confocal
microscope". What is wrong with this approach from a PID perspective, and
what should you do?

    [( )] Nothing is wrong — free text is sufficient for instrument identification.
    [( )] The problem is that the microscope brand is mentioned; only model numbers should be used.
    [(X)] Free text is not machine-actionable. A dedicated structured field accepting instrument PIDs should be added, with correct backend mapping to DataCite's relatedIdentifier.
    [( )] The Notes field should be removed entirely, as instrument information belongs only in publications.

**Question 4**

According to the HZB use case, which of the following is the main reason why
the instrument → dataset link direction does not scale?

    [( )] DataCite does not support the required relation type for instrument-to-dataset links.
    [( )] Researchers are not allowed to add dataset PIDs to centrally managed instrument records.
    [(X)] A widely-used instrument may generate thousands of datasets, making it impractical to maintain a complete list in the instrument PID metadata.
    [( )] Instrument PID records have a maximum size limit that would be exceeded by too many related identifiers.

**Question 5**

Which of the following is NOT one of the three concrete responsibilities
of a repository manager regarding instrument PIDs?

    [( )] Providing a metadata field for instrument PIDs in the submission form.
    [( )] Ensuring the instrument PID field is correctly mapped to DataCite/ePIC in the backend.
    [( )] Informing researchers about the instrument PID field and how to use it.
    [(X)] Centrally registering instrument PIDs on behalf of all researchers depositing data.

**Question 6**

The SMS (Sensor Management System) and HZB represent two contrasting
implementation approaches. Which statement best captures the key difference?

    [( )] HZB uses B2INST while SMS uses DataCite — the choice of PID provider is the main distinction.
    [( )] SMS registers more instruments because it is a larger facility; the workflows are otherwise identical.
    [(X)] HZB uses centralized registration with manual metadata curation, while SMS uses a decentralized self-service model with automated sync and controlled vocabulary for quality control.
    [( )] SMS does not currently support instrument PIDs — it is planned for a future version.

**Question 7**

A researcher wants to link a sample that was analyzed using an instrument.
They ask whether they should link the sample directly to the instrument PID.
What is the correct recommendation?

    [( )] Yes — use relationType="IsCollectedBy" in the sample's PID metadata to link it to the instrument.
    [( )] Yes — but only if the instrument is registered with B2INST, not DataCite.
    [(X)] No — link the sample to the relevant dataset or publication instead. The sample-to-instrument connection is then captured implicitly.
    [( )] No — samples and instruments should never be linked at all.

## 10. Summary and Your Action List

You have completed the module. Here is a condensed summary and a practical
checklist to take back to your work.

### What you learned

**What instrument PIDs are**
Globally unique persistent identifiers for individual physical devices,
based on the PIDINST metadata schema and registered via B2INST (ePIC) or
DataCite (DOI).

**What good metadata looks like**
Three categories: instrument information (name, model, type, manufacturer),
contextual information (location, dates, related outputs), and organizational
information (owner, funding, access conditions).

**How instruments connect to other entities**
The key connection for repositories is **dataset → instrument** via
`relationType="IsCollectedBy"`. Instrument → dataset does not scale.
Direct sample-to-instrument linking is not recommended.

**Your three responsibilities**
1. Provide a metadata field for instrument PIDs
2. Correctly map it to DataCite/ePIC in the backend
3. Tell researchers it exists and how to use it

### Your action checklist

- [ ] Check whether your repository submission form has a field for instrument PIDs
- [ ] Verify whether the field (if it exists) is correctly mapped to `relatedIdentifier relationType="IsCollectedBy"` in DataCite
- [ ] Add explanatory text next to the field pointing researchers to the Federated Search and to the concept of instrument landing pages
- [ ] Consider adding a link to the PID4NFDI Instruments page in your submission guidance: https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/services/instruments/
- [ ] If your institution registers instrument PIDs centrally, coordinate with the responsible team to ensure citation suggestions are included on instrument landing pages

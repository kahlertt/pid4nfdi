# Registering IGSN IDs: A Guide for Repository Managers

**Author:** Rorie Edmunds | **Version:** 0.1 | **License:** CC BY 4.0

---

Welcome to this training module on **International Generic Sample Numbers
(IGSN IDs)**. It is designed specifically for **repository managers** working
within or connected to the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI).

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Explain what an IGSN ID is and how it relates to DOIs
- Identify which objects in your repository can receive an IGSN ID
- Describe the four key purposes IGSN IDs serve for sample management
- Outline the steps your organization needs to take to register IGSN IDs
- Know when to use a Registered Service Provider instead of a custom workflow

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 10–15 minutes

## 1. What is the IGSN ID?

The **International Generic Sample Number (IGSN ID)** is a globally unique
and persistent identifier (PID) for **material samples** — physical objects
from any research discipline.

Its core purpose is to enable **transparent and traceable connections** among
research activities and related entities: samples, collections, instruments,
grants, datasets, publications, people, and organizations.

### The DOI connection

A key fact for repository managers: IGSN IDs are **functionally DataCite DOIs**.

This is the result of a 2021 partnership between **IGSN e.V.** and **DataCite**.
Under this partnership:

- DataCite provides IGSN ID registration through its existing services
- IGSN e.V. focuses on community advocacy and expanding the global samples ecosystem
- IGSN IDs inherit the credibility, wide recognition, and long-term sustainability of the DOI system

> 💡 **Key point:** If your organization already registers DataCite DOIs,
> you are already most of the way to registering IGSN IDs.

Even if DataCite were to cease operations, all registered IGSN IDs would
continue to persist — the same guarantee that applies to all DOIs.

---

## 2. What Can Receive an IGSN ID?

An IGSN ID can be assigned to **any material sample from any discipline**,
including both living specimens and lab-synthesized or manufactured materials.

The IGSN ID is assigned to the **physical object itself** — not to images of it,
nor to analytical data derived from it.

### Types of assignable objects

**Individual samples**
The most common case. Any single physical specimen, rock, tissue, artefact,
prototype, or similar object.

**Sample aggregations**
A collection of related objects that need to be referenced as a whole.
Individual samples within the collection become *children* of the parent
and can be linked hierarchically in the metadata.

**Sample collection sites**
The physical location where field sampling was carried out. Samples from
that site are registered as children of the site record.

**Ephemeral samples**
Samples that no longer exist — for example, consumed or destroyed during
analysis — can still receive an IGSN ID, provided the metadata clearly
documents the sample's current status.

### Disciplinary scope

The IGSN ID is genuinely cross-disciplinary. Examples include:

- **Physical & Earth Sciences:** rocks, minerals, sediment cores, soil, ice cores, atmospheric/water samples
- **Life Sciences:** tissues, cells, plant specimens, insects, microorganisms
- **Social Sciences & Humanities:** fossils, artefacts, tools, written records
- **Applied Sciences:** seed accessions, synthetic materials, prototypes
- **The Arts:** ceramics, sculptures, musical instruments, fashion/costume items

> 💡 **Key point for repository managers:** Around **13 million** publicly
> available IGSN IDs have been registered globally to date, with just over
> **200,000 from Germany** — primarily geoscience and material science samples.

## 3. The Four Purposes of IGSN IDs

The IGSN ID addresses four practical problems in sample management.
As a repository manager, these map directly to services you may already
be providing or planning to provide.

### 3.1 Discovery and Access

An IGSN ID **landing page** gives a sample its digital footprint — it makes
the sample part of Open Science by showing that the sample exists and that
metadata about it is available.

This is particularly important for **unique samples** where long-term
preservation of the object and its associated metadata is critical.

Landing page metadata should be:

- As rich and complete as possible
- Sensitive-information aware (not everything needs to be public)
- Enriched with images, maps/diagrams, and hierarchical relationship views

### 3.2 Inventory and Collection Management

IGSN IDs provide a simple, machine-readable way to link a physical sample
with its digital record by encoding the IGSN ID as an **actionable URI**
within a QR code or barcode affixed as a label to the sample.

This augments existing inventory and collection management systems without
replacing them. Labels should ideally also include the IGSN ID in
**human-readable** form alongside any local identifiers.

### 3.3 Unambiguous Sample Identity

Local sample identifiers have limited scope — they are often ambiguous
outside an organization, and they frequently change across different stages
of the sample management lifecycle.

The IGSN ID solves this by providing a **globally unique, stable identifier**
that persists as a sample moves between laboratories, archives, and institutions.

> ✅ **Best practice:** Register IGSN IDs as early as possible in the
> sample lifecycle — ideally at the point of **collection or creation**.
> Early registration is the most effective way to avoid ambiguity.

### 3.4 Crosslinking and Citation

IGSN ID metadata enables **structured relationships** to be described between
a sample and related research outputs — datasets, publications, parent/child
samples — using globally unique identifiers.

This supports:

- Citation of samples in publications
- Showing provenance of research results
- Appropriate attribution to individuals and organizations
- Reuse of samples with confidence

## 4. Mid-Course Check ✅

Four questions to consolidate what we have covered so far.

**Question 1**

Which statement about IGSN IDs is correct?

    [( )] IGSN IDs are a completely separate system from DOIs.
    [(X)] IGSN IDs are functionally DataCite DOIs using the same infrastructure.
    [( )] IGSN IDs can only be assigned to geoscience samples.
    [( )] IGSN IDs replace all local sample identifiers and require renaming existing samples.

**Question 2**

A researcher destroyed several soil cores during lab analysis. Can those
samples still receive an IGSN ID?

    [(X)] Yes — ephemeral samples can be registered as long as the metadata documents their current status.
    [( )] No — only samples that still physically exist can be registered.
    [( )] Only if photographic evidence was captured before destruction.

**Question 3**

At what point in a sample's lifecycle should an IGSN ID ideally be assigned?

    [( )] After the sample has been published in a journal article.
    [( )] When the sample is transferred to a long-term archive.
    [(X)] At the point of collection or creation — as early as possible.
    [( )] Only once the sample has been assigned a local identifier by the collecting institution.

**Question 4**

Which of the following is NOT a valid use of IGSN IDs?

    [( )] Assigning an identifier to a collection of related archaeological artefacts.
    [( )] Registering the field site where soil samples were collected.
    [(X)] Assigning an identifier to a dataset containing measurements derived from a sample.
    [( )] Registering a synthesized material science sample created in a laboratory.

## 5. How to Register IGSN IDs

### Who governs IGSN IDs?

IGSN IDs are governed through a partnership between two German-based associations:

**IGSN e.V.**
An international nonprofit with more than 20 members, operating a central
registration system since 2011. It focuses on community advocacy, expanding the
global samples ecosystem, and facilitating a *Community of Communities* for
standard methods of identifying, citing, and locating material samples.
IGSN e.V. is a member of NFDI.

**DataCite e.V.**
A community-led organization operating across more than 60 countries since 2009.
Under the partnership, DataCite provides IGSN ID registration through its services
and supports their ongoing sustainability. DataCite works with NFDI-related
organizations through its involvement in the PID4NFDI project.

### Who can register?

All **DataCite Direct Members**, **Consortium Leads**, and **Consortium
Organizations** can register IGSN IDs using DataCite services.

If your organization is not yet part of the DataCite community, the easiest
and most cost-effective route for German organizations is to join the
**DataCite Consortium led by TIB** (German National Library of Science and
Technology) — by far the largest DataCite consortium, with extensive technical
support for IGSN ID and DOI registration.

More information: https://datacite.org/become-a-member

> 💡 **Special case:** Individual researchers connected to a **Helmholtz Centre**
> in the geosciences can reach out to the Data Services at the GFZ Helmholtz
> Centre for Geosciences for IGSN ID registration support.

### What does it cost?

IGSN IDs use the **same fee model as DataCite DOIs**. There are no additional
membership or service charges. With 1 IGSN ID = 1 DOI, your organization is
simply charged for the total number of DOIs + IGSN IDs registered under the
standard fee tiers.

---

## 6. How IGSN IDs Work in DataCite Services

### Structure of an IGSN ID

An IGSN ID follows the standard DOI convention:

```
https://doi.org / 10.21384 / AU1234
                  ────────   ──────
                  Prefix     Suffix
```

- **Prefix:** A fixed number starting with `10.` — globally unique to the metadata collection
- **Suffix:** A customizable string that uniquely identifies the sample within that collection

> 💡 **Practical tip:** You can incorporate your organization's existing local
> sample identifiers as the suffix. The combination of prefix + suffix guarantees
> global uniqueness, so your internal naming conventions do not need to change.

### The IGSN ID Catalog Repository

The critical technical difference from standard DOI registration:

IGSN IDs must be registered in a **specific DataCite Repository type** called
the **IGSN ID Catalog**. This means:

- At least one **IGSN ID Catalog Repository** must be created in DataCite Fabrica
  alongside your existing DOI Repository account(s)
- The IGSN ID Catalog Repository has its own **separate credentials and prefix**
- It must be used **exclusively** for IGSN IDs — and vice versa, IGSN IDs must
  only be registered within an IGSN ID Catalog Repository

This is how IGSN IDs are differentiated within DataCite services — at the
metadata collection/prefix level, not at the individual record level.

### DataCite tooling

Because they are DataCite DOIs, IGSN IDs can be created and managed via:

- **DataCite Fabrica** — the web interface
- **DataCite APIs** — for automated/bulk registration
- **Registered Service Providers (RSPs)** — third-party integrations (see Section 7)

IGSN IDs also appear in **DataCite Commons** with dedicated search facets for
material samples, parent/child relationships, and connections to other DOIs.

### Metadata

IGSN ID metadata follows the **DataCite Metadata Schema**. The IGSN–DataCite
Crosswalk and Metadata Management Working Group has published dedicated
**IGSN ID Metadata Recommendations and Best Practices** to help map
sample metadata to the schema and ensure high quality and completeness.

---

## 7. Do You Need to Change Existing Workflows?

The short answer for most organizations: **probably not much**.

### Checklist for your organization

Before starting IGSN ID registration, gather the right people — researchers
with domain knowledge, data and information specialists — and work through
these questions:

- [ ] Can our current DOI registration system handle **multiple Repository credentials and prefixes**? If not, does it need to be modified, or should a new system be created?
- [ ] Should the team managing DOI registration also control the IGSN ID Catalog Repository, or should domain experts manage it?
- [ ] Should the team creating DOI landing pages also build IGSN ID landing pages, or should domain experts handle those?
- [ ] What **metadata sources** are available for sample discovery? (See also: *Integrating Disciplinary Metadata into PID Metadata Schemas*)
- [ ] Is a **common landing page template** feasible, or do different sample types require customized pages?
- [ ] How will we handle **linking related research outputs**, granularity, versioning, and embargos? (See also: *Linking Research Entities & Outputs in PID Metadata*)

---

## 8. Using a Registered Service Provider

If your organization is a DataCite Member or Consortium Organization but
**does not have the capacity** to set up a sample registration workflow,
you can work with one of DataCite's **Registered Service Providers (RSPs)**.

Currently two RSPs offer IGSN ID registration services, both with links to Germany:

**RSpace (Research Space)**
An electronic lab notebook and research data management platform.
Offers IGSN ID registration integrated into sample and inventory management.
→ [RSpace Website](https://www.researchspace.com) |
[IGSN ID Exemplars Blog Post](https://datacite.org/blog/) |
[Samples 101 guidance document](https://datacite.org/blog/)

**SESAR (System for Earth and Extraterrestrial Sample Registration)**
A long-running community sample registry, particularly strong in geosciences.
Can also support **individual researchers** with sample management and IGSN ID registration.

## 9. Benefits Summary: IGSN IDs and FAIR

IGSN IDs help ensure samples adhere to the **FAIR Principles** and the
principles of **Open Science**:

| Principle | How IGSN IDs help |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Findable** | Samples become discoverable and citable over time via landing pages and DataCite Commons |
| **Accessible** | Provides access to samples distributed across multiple repositories and their metadata |
| **Interoperable** | Standard metadata schema enables consistent identification and integration across systems |
| **Reusable** | Enables confident referencing, reuse, and proper attribution |
| **Open** | Metadata is in the public domain under CC0; sample existence is exposed globally |
| **CARE** | Metadata can include Traditional Knowledge or Biocultural Notices and Labels to recognize indigenous data sovereignty |

## 10. Final Assessment ✅

**Question 1**

Your organization already registers DataCite DOIs. What additional step is
specifically required to start registering IGSN IDs?

    [( )] Register as a new DataCite member with a separate membership fee for IGSN IDs.
    [(X)] Create at least one IGSN ID Catalog Repository in DataCite Fabrica with a separate prefix.
    [( )] Switch all existing DOI registrations to IGSN ID format.
    [( )] Contact IGSN e.V. directly to request a registration token.

**Question 2**

Which of the following suffix strategies for IGSN IDs is explicitly supported?

    [( )] Suffixes must follow a standardized global format defined by IGSN e.V.
    [(X)] Existing local sample identifiers can be incorporated as the suffix.
    [( )] Suffixes are always auto-generated by DataCite Fabrica and cannot be customized.
    [( )] Suffixes must be identical to the sample's DOI suffix if one exists.

**Question 3**

What is the cost implication of registering IGSN IDs for an organization
already registered with DataCite?

    [( )] There is an additional annual fee for the IGSN ID service on top of the DataCite membership.
    [( )] IGSN IDs are free of charge — no cost applies regardless of how many are registered.
    [(X)] No additional membership fees apply; IGSN IDs count as DOIs under existing fee tiers.
    [( )] Costs depend on the number of samples and must be negotiated with IGSN e.V. separately.

**Question 4**

Which statement about IGSN IDs and FAIR principles is correct?

    [( )] IGSN IDs only address Findability, since they are primarily a discovery tool.
    [( )] IGSN ID metadata is proprietary and cannot be shared openly.
    [(X)] IGSN IDs support all four FAIR principles as well as Open Science and CARE principles.
    [( )] IGSN IDs are only relevant for Reusability because they enable proper attribution.

**Question 5**

Your repository serves a small geosciences research group without a dedicated
data team. They want to register IGSN IDs but cannot build a custom workflow.
What is the most appropriate recommendation?

    [( )] Ask them to wait until your organization can build a full integration.
    [( )] Recommend they register IGSN IDs manually one by one via DataCite Fabrica only.
    [(X)] Direct them to SESAR or RSpace as Registered Service Providers that can handle registration for them.
    [( )] Advise them that IGSN IDs are not suitable for small research groups.

## Summary and Next Steps

You have completed the module. Here is what to take away:

**What IGSN IDs are**
Globally unique PIDs for physical samples — functionally DataCite DOIs,
governed jointly by IGSN e.V. and DataCite.

**What they can be assigned to**
Any material sample from any discipline, including aggregations, collection
sites, and ephemeral samples.

**Why they matter**
They support discovery, inventory management, unambiguous identity, and
crosslinking — making samples FAIR and citable.

**How to get started**
If your organization is a DataCite member: create an IGSN ID Catalog Repository
in Fabrica, assign a separate prefix, and start registering.
If not: join via TIB's DataCite Consortium or work with an RSP.

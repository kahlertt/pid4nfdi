        The International Generic Sample Number (IGSN) is a globally unique, persistent identifier for physical samples - rock samples, sediment cores, water samples, biological specimens, cultural heritage objects, and many more.
             
        ## They enable:

        - persistent citation of samples
        - interoperability across repositories
        - integration into the global PID ecosystem
        - machine-actionable linking between samples, datasets, publications, projects, people and instruments


        ## This page serves as:

        - a mapping of IGSN-related activities within and around NFDI
        - an overview of available IGSN services
        - a curated collection of training and guidance materials
        - a coordination space for ongoing and planned activities

        #### DataCite

        DataCite became the technical registrar for IGSN IDs in 2022. Any DataCite member repository can register IGSN IDs, provided they meet the metadata requirements.

        ## 
        IGSNs are used across a wide range of scientific disciplines and heritage domains. Below is an overview of active communities and initiatives.

        #### Earth and Environmental Sciences
        IGSNs originated in the geoscience community and remain most widely adopted here. Key institutions and projects include:

        - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences - One of the leading IGSN implementers in Germany. GFZ Data Services operates an IGSN service and has published detailed implementation exemplars (see the DataCite blog post on https://datacite.org/blog/igsn-id-implementation-exemplars-gfz-data-services/). GFZ also hosts the IGSN e.V. secretariat.
        - Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC) – Earth and Environment Hub – Operated the FAIR WISH project (with partners AWI, Hereon and GFZ), which developed discipline-specific IGSN metadata schemas and semi-automated workflows for IGSN registration. FAIR WISH results feed into the follow-up project FAIR AIMS.
        - NFDI4Earth – The German NFDI consortium for Earth System Sciences. Its User Support Network (USN) at GFZ Data Services provides support for IGSN assignment to physical samples and collections.

        #### Archaeology / Cultural Heritage
        A growing international community is establishing IGSN use for cultural heritage samples:
        
        - Heritage Samples / E-RIHS – An international consortium (including CNRS, Getty Conservation Institute and others) is building an IGSN service for cultural heritage. A rough landing page exists at heritagesamples.org. A community survey to reach relevant communities is being prepared.
        - The crosswalks between the IGSN core schema and heritage metadata have been published: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17446558 
        - The original Archaeology metadata schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17254975 
        - A working Heritage Samples Data Architecture (HSDA) profile on GitHub: https://github.com/E-RIHS/HSDA/blob/main/schema/Sample-v0.8.schema.json

        #### ARDC IGSN Service (Australia)
        The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) provides a dedicated IGSN service, primarily for Australian researchers but relevant as a reference implementation.

        #### FAIR-Impact
        FAIR-Impact
        FAIR-Impact is a European project supporting the practical implementation of FAIR principles across research infrastructures, including guidance, support actions, and community coordination relevant to persistent identifiers such as IGSNs.        
        https://fair-impact.eu/ 

        #### FAIR WISH
        FAIR WISH (FAIR Workflows for IGSN-based Sample Handling) was a Helmholtz-led project that developed domain-specific IGSN metadata profiles and semi-automated workflows to facilitate standardized sample registration and interoperability in Earth and environmental sciences.        
        https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/de/inf-projects/fair-wish 
        
        #### FAIR AIMS
        FAIR AIMS builds on the outcomes of FAIR WISH to further operationalise IGSN-based sample identification by refining metadata profiles, improving integration into infrastructure workflows, and strengthening cross-community adoption.
